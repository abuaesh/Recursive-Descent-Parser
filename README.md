# Recursive-Descent-Parser
A recursive-descent parser that will handle syntax errors  for the C- grammar specified in:  Kenneth Louden, Compiler Construction: Principles and Practice,  Course Technology.

## How it works
1. First, you have to compile and run the lexxer with the file containing the C-code you wish to compile. You can do this from [here](https://github.com/abuaesh/Lex-Scanner)
2. Then, compile and run the parser file.
3. Upon execution, the parser will ask you to enter the input file. The input to the parser is the output generated by the [Lex parser](https://github.com/abuaesh/Lex-Scanner) from step 1.
